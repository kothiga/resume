\cvevent{Software Developer II}{IBM}{2023 -- Present}{Toronto, ON}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I work on a team that develops \textbf{tracing} and \textbf{backend} components of the observability platform \href{https://www.ibm.com/products/instana}{Instana}.
    \item I have provided open source contributions to the OLAP database \href{https://clickhouse.com/}{ClickHouse} to fix \textbf{Big-Endian} serialization bugs which then provided support for the s390x (IBM-Z) architecture.
    \item Within Instana, I currently work on a tracing component for PHP and have developed an open source \href{https://opentelemetry.io/}{OpenTelemetry} exporter which allows compatibility between the otel PHP SDK and Instana.
\end{itemize}

\divider

\cvevent{Software Developer II}{BlackBerry}{2022 -- 2023}{Waterloo, ON}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I was on a team that developed various customer-facing \textbf{software samples} to demonstrate development with the \href{https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy}{Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform (IVY)} framework. One such was a POC demo called Occupancy Identity Synthetic-Sensor, a machine learning system to \textbf{identify} and \textbf{remember} individuals inside a vehicle using facial embeddings.
    \item I led a technical investigation into developing a set of high-quality samples to show how \textbf{hardware data} can be integrated into the IVY framework.
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Graduate Research Assistant}{SIRRL}{2019 -- 2022}{Waterloo, ON}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I was a member of the \textbf{Social and Intelligent Robotics Research Lab} (SIRRL) at the University of Waterloo. With this group, I worked with the \href{https://icub-tech-iit.github.io/documentation/}{iCub humanoid robot} and the \href{https://robots.ieee.org/robots/qtrobot/}{QTrobot}.
    \item For my research project I developed a \textbf{conceptual framework} for providing physiological data to robotic systems for real-time adaptation. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, human participant research was restricted, which led me to implement a simple proof of concept scenario involving a \textbf{physiologically-aware} \href{https://doi.org/10.1109/RO-MAN50785.2021.9515383}{robotic exercise coach}.
    \item In 2020 I received a \textbf{research grant} from Microsoft which provided funding to hire two coop students that I had the opportunity to mentor for a summer.
    \item I have \textbf{collaborated} with colleagues on research projects and coauthored work related to people's expectations with an \href{https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2021.3083465}{unreliable robot} and exploration of if a robot can divert you from \href{https://doi.org/10.1145/3623809.3623879}{social engineering attacks}.
\end{itemize}

\divider

\cvevent{Teaching Assistant}{University of Waterloo}{2019 -- 2022}{Waterloo, ON}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I TA'd a variety of courses in the Faculty of Engineering, including \textit{Algorithms and Data Structures}, \textit{Introduction to Design}, and \textit{Discrete Mathematics and Logic}.
    \item I led weekly tutorials and labs; held office hours; and graded for exams.
\end{itemize}

\divider

\cvevent{Undergraduate Research Assistant}{Cognitive Robotics Lab}{2017 -- 2019}{Lethbridge, AB}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I was a member of the Cognitive Robotics Lab at the University of Lethbridge, where I developed a \textbf{biologically inspired} \href{https://doi.org/10.1109/ROSE.2019.8790411}{audio attention system} for the iCub.
    \item During this time I received funding through \textbf{NSERC}, as well as \textbf{Mitacs} which allowed me to spend a semester abroad in Genoa, Italy collaborating with international colleagues.
\end{itemize}
